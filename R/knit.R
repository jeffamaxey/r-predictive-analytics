## How to convert to a nice pdf format:
## - Put spaces after all #,##,### headers (#{2,}[a-z,A-Z]+)
## - Add \newcommands to preamble.tex
## - Add this to the top chunk:
##    if(knitr::is_html_output()){options(knitr.table.format = "html")} else {options(knitr.table.format = "latex")}
## - Add R inline chunk to define newcommands if knitr::is_html_output()
## - eqnarray shouldn't have empty lines in them
## - escape = F in tex tables
## - Can't have math expressions in \textrm (e.g. \textrm{age^2} should be changed to \textrm{age}^2)
## - Can't have line breaks in equation environments, should convert to eqnarray or align or some other
## - If there are escape character issues, we can create cross-compatibility between platforms using text references.
##   - e.g. (ref:foo) This is some text.  ... fig.cap='(ref:foo)', see also chapter 7

## ISSUES
## - Current undiagnosable issue in Chapter 6
##   - Got it to work, was an issue with the eqnarray environment, so I switched to align
## - A different issue with Chapter 7
##   - Fixed issue, it was with & in eqnarray, switched to alignedat for best results
##   - Current issue with \% needed for pdf, but then \ showing up in LaTeX
## - Chapter 8 also had issues with equation array for a cases.
##   - Resolved by changing from array environment to tabular environment. Note that cases environment from amsmath did not work here.

## HOW TO DIAGNOSE ISSUES
## 1. How compilation of PDF works
##   a. bookdown compiles all of the relevant chapter .Rmd files into one large .Rmd called bookdown-bysh.Rmd
##   b. The R chunks are run and the document compiled into bookdown-bysh.tex.
##   c. The .tex file is compiled into the final pdf.
## 2. If there is an error in the compilation, it will typically occur with the .tex file.
## 3. The error message presented in the command line comes from bookdown-bysh.log, and will be the last message at the bottom of this file.
## 4. This references a line number from bookdown-bysh.tex.
## 5. Often the error message doesn't directly address the problem, so look for anything weird with the refernced chunk.

## Notes on knitting:
##  - Best to use tinytex package from yihui for compatbility
##  - Updated preamble.tex for the Shaded environment.
##  - Make sure to set kableExtra to pdf mode and not have it set to html as an argument.
##  - should update index.Rmd with the necessary packages at the top.


## Notes for Paul for PDF:
## - Most tables do not fit due to headers that are too wide, text needs to be abbreviated.
## - Quotes appear differently, and are very blockly and unclear under krantz style. Consider restyling or removing block quotes.
## - some equations don't fit nicely.
