Welcome!  This is the [online version](https://jeffamaxey.github.io/r-predictive-analytics/) of _**Predictive Analytics: Theory of and Case Studies in Predictive Analytics Using R**_.

This is the online version of the `r colorize("SOA Exam PA Study Notes", "red")`, a guide that is
**`r colorize("currently under early development", "red")` and intended for to be released on
[Github](https://www.github.com/jeffamaxey/r-predictive-analytics/) at a later
date.

This document was designed to capture study notes from the reading of the ACTEX
Study Manual for Exam PA, and encapsulates all chapters of the SOA Exam Syllabus
in preparation of taking the Predictive Analytics Exam (Exam PA). Throughout
this guide, we the goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the basics of R
programming, the theory of and relevent case studies in predictive analytics,
and provide final preparation tactics in the form of a discussion on past exams,
sample mock exams, and a formula sheet.

## Description {#description .unnumbered}

`r colorize("Predictive Analytics in R", "red")`is a textbook on predictive analytics for actuarial science, featuring applied case studies covering numerous unique real data sets. 
This textbook is intended to be accessible to scholars and professionals. We believe strongly in case studies featuring real data and real research applications; thus, most of the data in the textbook arises from collaborative research conducted by the authors during their professional work or academic coursework. 

After working through the material in this manual, readers will have developed an expanded toolkit and a greater appreciation for the wide world of predictive 
modeling and actuarial science.

Three types of exercises are available for each chapter:

-   **`r colorize("Conceptual Exercises", "red")`** ask about key ideas in the contexts of case studies
    from the chapter and additional research articles where those ideas appear.\
-   **`r colorize("Guided Exercises", "red")`** provide real data sets with background descriptions and
    lead students step-by-step through a set of questions to explore the data,
    build and interpret models, and address key research questions.\
-   **`r colorize("Open-Ended Exercises", "red")`** provide real data sets with contextual descriptions
    and ask students to explore key questions without prescribing specific
    steps.

Source code and solutions to all exercises in this manual will be available at
the projects [Github Repository](https://jeffamaxey.github.io/r-predictive-analytics/).

**Note**: This book follows the ACTEX Exam PA study manual and contains study notes from readings in the ACTEX manual. The online version of the ACTEX manual is available and highly recommended for purchase here at [ACTEXmadriver.com](https://www.ACTEXlearning.com/exams/pa).
```

## System Requirements {#system-requirements .unnumbered}

This book was written in [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/) using
[bookdown](http://bookdown.org/).

The [website](http://jeffamaxey.github.io/soa-exam-pa) is hosted with [Github
Pages](https://github.com/), and automatically updated after every commit by
[Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). The complete source is
available from [GitHub](https://github.com/jeffamaxey/soa-exa-pa).

This version of the book was built with **`r R.version.string`** and the following packages:

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tibble)
library(kableExtra)

required.pkgs <- c(
  "bookdown", "boot", "broom", "bslib", "caret", "cli", "curl", "data.table",
  "desc", "downlit", "dplyr", "DT", "formatR", "fs", "gapminder", "GGally",
  "ggforce", "ggmosaic", "ggplot2", "gh", "glmnet", "globals", "glue",
  "gridExtra", "hexSticker", "Hmisc", "ICC", "ISLR", "janitor", "jsonlite",
  "jtools", "kableExtra", "knitr", "lares", "lattice", "lme4", "magick", "MASS",
  "methods", "mice", "mnormt", "mosaic", "multcomp", "nlme", "openintro",
  "pander", "png", "pROC", "profvis", "pscl", "purrr", "remotes", "renv",
  "reshape2", "rlang", "rmarkdown", "rpart", "rpart.plot", "rsample", "rsconnect",
  "RSQLite", "sessioninfo", "shiny", "shinycssloaders", "shinyFeedback",
  "shinyloadtest", "shinytest", "shinythemes", "styler", "sysfonts", "testthat",
  "thematic", "tibble", "tidyverse", "tinytex", "vctrs", "vroom", "waiter",
  "waldo", "webshot", "xfun", "xml2", "xtable", "yaml", "zeallot"
)

package_info(required.pkgs) %>%
  tibble::as_tibble() %>%
  dplyr::filter(attached == TRUE) %>%
  dplyr::select(package, version = ondiskversion) %>%
  kable(
    booktabs = TRUE,
    linesep = "",
    longtable = TRUE,
    digits = 2,
    big.mark = ",",
    scientific = FALSE,
    col.names = c("R package", "Version Used"),
    caption = "R Packages"
  ) %>%
  kable_styling()
```

If you are seeing different results than what is in the book, we recommend
installing the exact version of the packages we used. This can be done by first
installing the `remotes` package via **`install.packages("remotes")`**. 

Then, use **`install_version()`** replacing the **`package`** argument with the package name in quotes and the **`version`** argument with the particular version number to install. For example:: 


```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_version(package = "broom", version = "0.5.6")
```

We do not add prompts (**`>`** and **`+`**) to R source code in this book, and we comment out the text output with two hashes **`##`** by default, as you can see from the R session information above. This is for your convenience when you want to copy and run the code (the text output will be ignored since it is commented out). 

Package names are in bold text (e.g., **rmarkdown**), and inline code and
file names are formatted in a typewriter font (e.g., **`knitr::knit('foo.Rmd')`**). Function names are followed by parentheses (e.g., **`bookdown::render_book()`**). The double-colon operator **`::`** means accessing an object from a package.
